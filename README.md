# Portfolio Homework Read Me

## Summary

This application generates a basic website with 3 pages: (1) About Me (2) Contact Me (3) Portfolio. The website was constructed with bootstrap and bootstrap's grid system to ensure that it could be viewed in multiple devices of varying sizes. 

The process for building this webpage took a few iterations since the the grid system is a challenging subject for this coder. Most of the work was focused on the responsibe layout and images so pieces of the aesthetic could be improved in future iterations.

In the future, this would be a great place to add content that has been built. Currently the content is a lot of placeholder information.

## Code Snippet

To minimize the use of media queries, I specified the grid values for sm (relevant to 640) and md (relevant to 768 and 980). So in the case of screen size of 768 and above, I wanted the images to take about half of the space available whereas at the smallest size, I wanted them to take most of the space.

	<div class="card text-white col-md-6 col-sm-12 float-left">
		<img class="card-img" src="Images/placeimg_200_150_tech (1).jpg" alt="Stock Word Guess">
		<div class="card-footer bg-info pb-2">Word Guess</div>
	</div>
